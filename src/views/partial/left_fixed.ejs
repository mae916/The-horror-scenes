          “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of
          the most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares,
          others may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that
          aren't necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of
          horror.

          Best Horror Scenes is a love letter to the Horror film genre by
          Brandon Durham. Most film clips contain major spoilers, and it is
          recommended you don’t watch the clip if you plan on seeing the
          film.
